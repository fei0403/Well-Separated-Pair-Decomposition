# Well Separated Pair Decomposition
A java application for computing a Well Separated Pair Decomposition. The implemented algorithms are based on algorithms presented by Giri Narasimhan and Michael Smid in "Geometri Spanner Networks".
The applications use the Java library ProGAL (http://www.diku.dk/~rfonseca/ProGAL/) to geometry computations and to draw a Well Separated Pair Decomposition in 2D. 

Building
--------
Requires Java and Apache Ant. To build the application, clone the repository and run:
```
ant all
```
in the root of the repository. This will create an 'out'-folder, which contains the compiled files.
